# EVALIMINE

## Purpose

No, this is not the repo that is used for active development. The active development takes place in the private repositories of the software developer (currently Cybernetica AS).

Yes, this repo will be maintained. The next milestone is mid-august. NEC (National Electoral Committee) plans to publish the final source version also in this repo, so the code that can be found here is the actual code that is used for election.

Some additional documentation is going to be released before the august though.
